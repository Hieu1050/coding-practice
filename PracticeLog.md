    **Rotating a 2d square matrix:** Key idea: Flipping a matrix (x, y or x = y axes) is easier than rotating it. Rotating a matrix by 90 degree can be performed with 2 flipping instead of straightfoward method.
    
    ****[Set Matrix Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/):** Key idea: the first row and column can be used for storing locations of modification to optimize space to O(1).
